# Natural_Language_Processing
Removing Stopwords and puntuations from a  given text

This is the Basic implementation of Natural Language Processing(NLP). Here we were given an excel sheet of text data.
Our motive was to remove unnecessary words which do not add relevant meaning to the text without changing the actual 
meaning of the text. The process started by some textpreprocessing followed by normalization and then vectorization.
The result is exported back to the new excel file which is attached to my repository. So This is basically the text summariser that takes these 
descriptions as input and summarises them into shorter versions without loosing the context.
